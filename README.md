### Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree

All the impportant packages required in this project has been mentioned in **requirements.txt**.

# Project Design

The project's domain **background** — This is a blog I have written as a final project submission for my nano degree program with Udacity in Machine Learning Engineering. 

A **problem statement** — The main goal of this project is to understand how to acquire more clients or customers efficiently. This was the job of Subject Matter Experts who used to decide on the basis of the experience and business knowledge only. Objective of this project is to help them in making these decisions on the basis of data. 
There are majorly 3 components to this project:
- Customer segmentation report
- Supervised learning model
- Kaggle Competition
 
The **datasets** and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem:
Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).
Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).
Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).
 
A **solution** statement — The solution will be comprised of following 3 deliverables:

**Customer Segmentation Report**: This will be a Jupyter Notebook with markdown notes and visualizations.This notebook will contain all the codes for pre-processing and feature engineering of the data.
**Supervised Learning Model**: This will be a supervised model object that uses demographics attributes to segment people into potential customers or non-potential customers.
